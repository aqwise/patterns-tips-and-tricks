# Factory Pattern Example in Java

## Project Overview

This is a simple Maven-based Java project that demonstrates the implementation of the Factory design pattern using both an enum and sealed classes. The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Explanation of Key Components

- **App.java**: The main entry point for the application, demonstrating the use of the Factory pattern.
- **Product.java**: The sealed interface that represents the products created by the factory.
- **ConcreteProductA.java** and **ConcreteProductB.java**: Implementations of the `Product` interface, representing different types of products.
- **ProductFactory.java**: The factory class responsible for creating instances of `Product` based on the provided type.
- **ProductType.java**: An enum representing the different product types, used in the factory method.
- **ProductTypeSealed.java**, **ProductTypeA.java**, **ProductTypeB.java**: Sealed interface and its implementations, providing an alternative way to represent product types.

## Using the Factory Pattern

### 1. Enum-Based Implementation

The `ProductType` enum is used to represent the different types of products that the factory can create.

```java
public enum ProductType {
    PRODUCT_A,
    PRODUCT_B
}
```

The factory method then switches on this enum to create the appropriate product.

### 2. Sealed Class-Based Implementation

Instead of using an enum, you can use a sealed interface (`ProductTypeSealed`) to represent product types. This approach provides more flexibility if the product types themselves need to have behavior.

```java
public sealed interface ProductTypeSealed permits ProductTypeA, ProductTypeB {
}
```

## Running the Project

To compile and run the project, use the following Maven commands:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd factory-pattern-example
   ```

2. **Compile and run the project:**

   ```sh
   mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.App"
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**

   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Factory pattern in Java using both enums and sealed classes. The approach used can be extended or modified depending on the complexity and requirements of your project.
